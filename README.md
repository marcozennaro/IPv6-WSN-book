# IoT in 5 days: an easy guide to Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), IPv6 and the Internet of Things (IoT)

This booklet is a quick but thoughtful guide to jump into the Internet of Things, covering important subjects as IPv6 networking, sensors, wireless protocols and technologies, as well as IoT cloud platforms and its most commonly used protocols, featuring lots of _hands-on_ examples to start working from day one.

The lessons and examples are heavily focused on Contiki OS, a well known IoT operating system well suited for low power embedded devices, and the Zolertia Z1 mote, a widely used hardware platform to develop a wide range of IoT applications.  The Raspberry Pi is used as well.

## Topics covered:

- Introduction to IoT.
- Introduction to IPv6.
- Introduction to 6LoWPAN.
- Contiki OS, installation, structure and libraries.
- Analogue and digital sensors.
- Wireless and RF basics.
- UDP and TCP over multi-hop mesh networks.
- MQTT, CoAP and RESTFull protocols.
- End-to-end IPv6 applications: connecting to IoT cloud platforms

## Releases

A first draft of this book was showcased, and heavily used, in the Workshop on Scientific Applications for the Internet of Things (IoT), hosted at the Abdus Salam International Centre of Theoretical Physics (ICTP), in Trieste, Italy, from 16 to 27 March 2015.  The commit of the PDF is available [Here](https://github.com/alignan/IPv6-WSN-book/commit/2de741e412ac11a9b39327385f37957b201c5124).

A Spanish translated version of the "IoT in five days" book, close to the first draft, was used for the "18º Workshop para America Latina y el Caribe" (WALC15), hosted at the CTEC (Centro de Transferencia Tecnologica y de Educacion Continua) and TEC (Tecnologico de Costa Rica) in Costa Rica, from 16-20 November 2015.  A link to the Spanish book is available [Here](http://wireless.ictp.it/Papers/InternetdelasCosas.pdf).

The "IoT in five days" book has also been used in the Internet of Things Summer-Winter summer school 2016, hosted at the UNLP (National University of La Plata), in La Plata, Argentina, from 28 February to 4 March 2016.

A second release, and namely the first official v1.0 release was produced for the Workshop on New Frontiers in Internet of Things, hosted at the Abdus Salam International Centre of Theoretical Physics (ICTP), in Trieste, Italy, from 7-18 March 2016.  The PDF, HTML and epub formats are available [Here](https://github.com/marcozennaro/IPv6-WSN-book/releases/tag/v1.0).

The new v.1.1 release is to be used in the Summer School on IoT, hosted by the CEA-IoT (Centro de Excelencia y Apropiacion en Internet de las Cosas) at the "Pontificia Universidad Javeriana", in Bogota-Colombia, from July 11-16 July 2016.  The PDF, HTML and epub formats are available [Here](https://github.com/marcozennaro/IPv6-WSN-book/releases/tag/v1.1).
